    <h1>Books That Kept Me Up All Night 📚</h1>
    <p>You ever tell yourself “just one more chapter” and suddenly the sun’s coming up? Yeah, that’s me on a regular basis. The right book can grip you so hard you forget about time, deadlines, and the concept of sleep.</p>

    <p>Some thrillers had me side-eyeing everyone in my life, romances made me giggle like a teenager, and fantasy novels dropped me into worlds I never wanted to leave. Those nights cost me hours of sleep, but they gave me stories that stayed long after the last page. Honestly? Worth it every time.</p>
